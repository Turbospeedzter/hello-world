# hello-world
the beginnings of great creations, mostly in Java.

My pages reflect a progression of knowledge-building in software development.  

Having diverged from this pursuit many years ago, I have delved into the universe of software once again in order to create new universes 
of science, sci-fi, and robotics areas of design, including hardware, software, and mental perspectives, some of which (the sci-fi) will be limited to private until the books are published.

My video games include MechWarrior, Metal Gear, TitanFall, Splinter Cell, and Spider-Man.  Therefore, my own creations will follow the same themes, like war in the future, including my upcoming sci-fi novel, The Domes of Mars, part of a much larger series of future worlds developed by the descendants of humans, sci-fi Apps, and other areas of nerdly activities.  

Otherwise, the software projects will be quite primitive to most viewers but important to my progression.--TurboS
